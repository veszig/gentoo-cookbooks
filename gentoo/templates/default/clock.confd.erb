# /etc/conf.d/clock

# Set CLOCK to "UTC" if your hardware clock is set to UTC (also known as
# Greenwich Mean Time).  If that clock is set to the local time, then
# set CLOCK to "local".
# Note that if you dual boot with Windows, then you should set it to
# "local" because Windows always sets the hardware clock to local time.

CLOCK="<%= @hwtimezone %>"

# Select the proper timezone.  For valid values, peek inside of the
# /usr/share/zoneinfo/ directory.  For example, some common values are
# "America/New_York" or "EST5EDT" or "Europe/Berlin".  If you want to
# manage /etc/localtime yourself, set this to "".

TIMEZONE="<%= @timezone %>"

# If you wish to pass any other arguments to hwclock during bootup,
# you may do so here.

CLOCK_OPTS=""

# If you want to set the Hardware Clock to the current System Time (software
# clock) during shutdown, then say "yes" here.

CLOCK_SYSTOHC="<%= %w(yes true on 1).include?(@synchwclock.to_s) ? "yes" : "no" %>"
